# Written Analysis of the Election Audit 

## Overview of Project
For this project a Colorado Board of Elections employee, Seth, has asked for help in completing an election audit of a recent local congressional election. Seth has asked for the following tasks to be completed:
- Calculate the total number of votes cast.
- Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
- Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
- Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
- Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 

All of which was accomplished under the "PyPoll.py" python file. Additionally the election commission has also requested:

- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

All of which is contained within the “PyPoll_Challange.py” Python file and the results of which could be easily read in the election_analysis.txt.
