# Explaining the Code

## Introduction

This Readme is not a part of the challenge but rather a personal addition created to further explain the code and why some lines of code are used. This will make it easier to review further down the line should I ever need to revisit syntax and forget what some lines accomplishes. The challenge itself is called "PyPoll_Challange.py" while the homework file was named "PyPoll.py" much of the challenge is simply restructuring what we have learned in "PyPoll.py" and making it work in the challenge file. I will add screenshots where it is necessary.
